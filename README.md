# Thinkful Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

This is an application for a restaurant to be able to handle reservations and seating in their enviroment. The project was a final project for my Thinkful Engineering Flex Program. Below are some highlights on the application.

Users have a dashboard that will display any reservations for the day, as well as all tables that the restrauant handles. This highlights important information about reservations and tables. Reservations include an easy to view snapshot of the guest's name, reservation time, party number, and status of the reservation. This list does **not** include finished reservations. Tables include the table name, their capacity, and a color coded status of if it is free or occupied.

In the menu, you can search by phone number, create a new reservation, or create a new table.

The Search page will search by phone number function will return every reservation, regardless of status.

The New Reservation page is a form that will allow you to make a reservation. However, if it falls outside of business hours, on a Tuesday (when the restuarant is closed), or in the past, the user will receive an error.

Likewise, on the New Table page, a table must have a valid capcity otherwise it will receive an error.

To edit a reservation, it follows the same control as creating a new reservation, but with information pre-filled in.

I hope this application is helpful for anyone that needs an effective way to handle restraurant reservations!
